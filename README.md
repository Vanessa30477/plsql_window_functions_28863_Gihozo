# Car Sales Analysis Using SQL JOINs & Window Functions

## Business Problem
### Business Context
A car dealership manages inventory, customers, and sales transactions across different car models, price ranges, and time periods. Management needs clear, data-driven insights to understand sales performance, customer behavior, and inventory efficiency in order to improve profitability and operational decisions.
### Data Challenge
Raw transactional data alone does not reveal trends, rankings, or customer patterns. Without combining tables and analyzing sales over time, the business cannot identify top-performing vehicles, inactive customers, or seasonal sales behavior.
### Expected Outcome
This analysis is expected to support better pricing strategies, customer targeting, and inventory planning by using SQL JOINs and Window Functions to extract meaningful insights from relational data.
